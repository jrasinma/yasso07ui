#summary How to install Yasso07

== Running Yasso07 ==

For a distribution of Yasso07 that you can just run from a single executable, download either:

[http://yasso07ui.googlecode.com/files/yasso07_1.0_exe_win.zip The Windows version]

or

[http://yasso07ui.googlecode.com/files/yasso07_1.0_exe_linux.tar.gz The Linux version]

Note that the Linux version is tested only on Ubuntu 8.04 and 8.10.

For those running Mac or interested in finding out how to run Yasso07 from the source, read on.

== Installing the requirements ==

Yasso07 user interface is written in [http://www.python.org Python] using the [http://code.enthought.com/projects/index.php Enthought Tool Suite]. Installing it is a bit of a hassle, so use the executable version if you can.

=== Python ===

Make sure you have Python 2.5 (or higher) installed. Open your console/terminal and type 

   `python`

You'll get the interactive Python shell if you have Python installed. At the beginning you should see the version number. To quit the interactive shell, press Ctrl-d.

If you need to install Python, head over to [http://www.python.org/download/ Python download] page for a suitable distribution.

=== Enthought Tool Suite ===

First, download [http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py this] python script and in the folder you downloaded is run:

   `sudo python ez_setup.py`
or 
   `python ez_setup.py`
if you're on Windows.

The next step is to easy_install Sphinx (required by Chaco below):

  `easy_install Sphinx`

Then, follow these [https://svn.enthought.com/enthought/wiki/Install instructions] to install the Enthought Tool Suite.

You don't have to install everything, the parts you'll need are: `Traits, TraitsGUI, TraitsBackendWX, Enable, Chaco, EnthoughtBase`.

That means, that besides Python and Setuptools, you need these installed for the ETS: `MinGW` (assuming you're using Windows), `Numpy`, `Swig` and `wxPython`

Note that you may run into incompatibility issues with the latest ETS package versions. In case you do, these versions should work:

Traits 3.1.0

TraitsGUI 3.0.4

TraitsBackendWX 3.1.0

Enable 3.0.2

Chaco 3.0.1

EnthoughtBase 3.0.2

You can install a specific version of a package with easy_install by downloading the version egg, and then installing that egg. For instance, remove the latest Traits installation, and install from egg:
 
 `easy_install -m Traits`

 `easy_install Traits-3.1.0-py2.5-win32.egg`

A note for Mac users: After having installed wxPython, add the path to the newly installed wx-config to your path before trying to easy_install Enable. Something like this:

   `export PATH=/usr/local/lib/wxPython-unicode-2.8.9.2/bin:$PATH`
   `sudo easy_install Enable[nonets]`
 
=== dateutil ===

Besides ETS, you need to install the dateutil package:

   `sudo easy_install python-dateutil`

== Finally ==

Grab the source distribution of Yasso07 (see the downloads tab), unzip it, open your console/terminal in the resulting yasso07-folder and issue the command

   `python yasso.py` 

or if you are using [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv virtualenv] with OS X, you should use:

   `pythonw yasso.py`

but in order to get that to work, see [http://github.com/gldnspud/virtualenv-pythonw-osx/tree/master this] link.

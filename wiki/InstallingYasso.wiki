#summary How to run Yasso07 from source

== Running Yasso07 ==

For a single executable distribution of Yasso07 (Win/Linux) head over to [http://www.environment.fi/syke/yasso Yasso's homepage].

For those running Mac or interested in finding out how to run Yasso07 from the source, read on.

== Installing the requirements ==

Yasso07 user interface is written in [http://www.python.org Python] using the [http://code.enthought.com/projects/index.php Enthought Tool Suite]. Installing it is a bit of a hassle, so use the [http://www.environment.fi/syke/yasso single executable] if you can.

=== Python ===

Make sure you have Python 2.5 (or higher) installed. Open your console/terminal and type 

   `python`

You'll get the interactive Python shell if you have Python installed. At the beginning you should see the version number. To quit the interactive shell, press Ctrl-d.

If you need to install Python, head over to [http://www.python.org/download/ Python download] page for a suitable distribution.

=== Enthought Tool Suite ===

First, download [http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py this] python script and in the folder you downloaded is run:

   `sudo python ez_setup.py`
or 
   `python ez_setup.py`
if you're on Windows.

Then, follow these [https://svn.enthought.com/enthought/wiki/Install instructions] to install the Enthought Tool Suite.

You don't have to install everything, the parts you'll need are: `Traits, TraitsGUI, TraitsBackendWX, Enable, Chaco, EnthoughtBase`

That means, that besides Python and Setuptools, you need these installed for the ETS: `MinGW` (assuming you're using Windows), `Numpy`, `Swig` and `wxPython`

A note for Mac users: After having installed wxPython, add the path to the newly installed wx-config to your path before trying to easy_install Enable. Something like this:

   `export PATH=/usr/local/lib/wxPython-unicode-2.8.9.2/bin:$PATH`
   `sudo easy_install Enable[nonets]`
 
=== dateutil ===

Besides ETS, you need to install the dateutil package:

   `sudo easy_install python-dateutil`

== Finally ==

Grab the source distribution of Yasso07 (see the downloads tab), unzip it, open your console/terminal in the resulting yasso07-folder and issue the command

`python yasso.py`

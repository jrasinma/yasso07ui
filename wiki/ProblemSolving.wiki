== Known problems with Yasso07 user interface ==

----

*Problem*: The main window disappears

When you minimize or maximize the program window for Yasso07, nothing seems to happen.

*Solution*: Quit the program and remove this file:
 * XP: `C:\Documents and Settings\<Your username>\Application Data\Enthought\traits\traits_ui`
 * Vista: `C:\Users\<Your username>\AppData\Local\Enthought\traits\traits_ui` or `C:\Users\<Your username>\AppData\Roaming\Enthought\traits\traits_ui`
 * Linux/OS X: `~/.enthought/traits/traits_ui`

----

*Problem*: Creating a new data file or using Save As.. on OS X

There's a bug in New file and Save As dialog on OS X which prevents you to actually create a new file through the dialog.

*Solution*: No real solution here, but the workaround is to create the new, empty file beforehand and then select it in the dialog.
